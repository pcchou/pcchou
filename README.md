👋 Hello! I'm Ping-yu, a junior student who currently studies Data Science and Mathematics under the Interdisciplinary Program of Science at National Tsing Hua University.

🌟 I mainly focus on my study now, however still interested in new stuffs that caught my attention, especially data-related ones. I'm looking forward to a data science career in the future. I consider data fascinating and worth our dedication because they capture many key insights in different aspects of our daily lives. I believe through more in-depth utilization of data, especially public ones, we can bring a better society as a whole.

💻 I am a Python enthusiast which is also keen to learn other technical skills. I have been a system administrator for technical role mostly, hence I am familiar in the Linux infrastructure, and experienced in the development and management of web services. Aside from that, I also have moderate frontend / backend skills including tools like Vue.js, webpack, Node.js, Django, Flask and such.

🤝 Here is a brief glimpse into my academic and professional journey. If you want to know more, you are welcome to contact me directly. Nice to meet you!
