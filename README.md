👋 **Hello! I'm Ping-yu**, a junior undergraduate student who currently studies [Data Science](https://stat.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/412-1327-1781.php?Lang=zh-tw) and [Mathematics](https://www.math.nthu.edu.tw/) under the [Interdisciplinary Program of Science](https://scidm.site.nthu.edu.tw/) at [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/). I'm looking forward to a data science career in the future.

🌟 I mainly focus on my study now, however still interested in new stuffs that caught my attention, especially data-related ones. I find data fascinating and worth our dedication because they capture many key insights in our daily lives. I believe through more in-depth utilization of data, especially public ones, we can bring a better society as a whole.

💻 I am a Python enthusiast which is also keen to learn other technical skills. I have been a system administrator for technical role on some occasions, hence I am familiar with the Linux infrastructure, and experienced in the development and management of web services. Aside from that, I also have moderate frontend / backend skills including tools like Vue.js, Webpack, Node.js, Django, Flask and such.
