👋 **Hello! I'm Ping-yu**, a junior undergraduate student at [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/) majoring in [Data Science](https://stat.site.nthu.edu.tw/p/412-1327-1781.php?Lang=zh-tw) through the [Interdisciplinary Program of Science](https://scidm.site.nthu.edu.tw/) (with a double specialty program of Computer Science). I am currently seeking a future career in data science within a broad range of industries.

🌟 While studies are my primary focus, I remain highly interested in new and captivating data-related topics, such as news, tools, and techniques. I find data science fascinates me because it reveals invaluable insights into our everyday lives. I firmly believe that by harnessing the power of data, we can contribute to a better society as a whole.

💻 I am a Python enthusiast which is also keen to learn other technical skills. I have rich programming backgrounds. I started programming and using Linux from about 10 years ago. I've had the opportunity to serve as a system administrator on various occasions, which has provided me with a strong familiarity with the Linux infrastructure, as well as experience in developing and managing web services.

⚙️ I have done paid projects multiple times, utilizing frontend / backend skills including tools like Vue.js, Webpack, Node.js, Django, Flask and more. I possess the ability to develop a web project from scratch. Working on these has broadened my horizon, and strengthened my ability on software development and project management.

🤝 Here is a brief glimpse into my academic and professional journey. If you want to know more, you are welcome to contact me directly. Nice to meet you!
